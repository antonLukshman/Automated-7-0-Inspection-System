The garment manufacturing industry faces challenges like inefficiencies, human errors, and delays in manual quality inspections. To address these, our project introduces an **Automated 7/0 Quality Inspection System** that leverages modern technologies such as **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Super-Resolution (SR)** to enhance accuracy, speed, and efficiency. The system aims to reduce defects, optimize workflows, and improve overall productivity for garment manufacturers.

## Features

### Key Features

- üß† **Automated Defect Detection**: Utilizes pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) models to detect defects such as stitching errors, fabric tears, and stains.
- üé® **Image Enhancement**: Employs ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks) to enhance low-quality images for more precise defect identification.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-Time Updates**: Provides instant notifications and updates through a supervisor dashboard for timely corrective actions.
- üì± **Mobile Application**: A user-friendly app for garment inspectors to capture and process images directly on the production floor.
- üåê **Centralized Data Management**: Logs all inspection data in a cloud-based system for analytics, trend identification, and process optimization.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Cross-platform mobile app development)
- **Backend**: Django (Data management and API integration)
- **Machine Learning Models**: YOLOv8 for object detection and ESRGAN for image enhancement
- **Database Management**: Cloud-based database for scalable and centralized storage
- **Collaboration Tools**: ClickUp, Slack, and Google Meet


---

## Benefits

- üöÄ **Increased Efficiency**: Automates inspections to minimize bottlenecks and delays.
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Accuracy**: Reduces human errors with consistent defect detection.
- üí∞ **Cost Savings**: Lowers costs associated with rework, waste, and customer returns.
- üìä **Improved Quality Control**: Real-time monitoring and comprehensive data analytics improve decision-making.

## Implementation Workflow


1. **Capture Image**: Inspectors use the mobile app to take garment images.
2. **Enhance Image**: The image is processed using ESRGAN for clarity.
3. **Analyze Defects**: YOLOv8 detects defects and categorizes them.
4. **Log Details**: The system records defect types, timestamps, and other metadata.
5. **Notify Supervisor**: Flags are raised and displayed on a real-time dashboard for immediate action.
6. **Optimize Processes**: Centralized data provides insights to identify trends and improve production quality.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Mobile Devices**: Smartphones or tablets with cameras
- **Edge Computing Devices**: For local processing and real-time decision-making
- **Routers**: Ensure smooth connectivity for data transfer and cloud synchronization

---

## Software Requirements

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch (ML model training), Flutter (mobile app development), Django (backend development)
- **Database**: Cloud-based database system
- **Version Control**: Git (e.g., GitHub) for code management
- **Design Tools**: Figma (for UI/UX design)
